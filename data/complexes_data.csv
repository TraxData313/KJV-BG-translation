one young bullock one ram one lamb of the first year for a burnt offering,12,15
the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh,4,15
because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof he is unclean unto you,3,15
above the liver and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them and,2,15
after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and,2,15
all the nethinims and the children of solomons servants were three hundred ninety and two,2,15
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven,2,15
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer,2,15
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his,2,15
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god,2,15
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant,2,15
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it,2,15
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering and slay,2,15

and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to,2,15
and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever,2,15
and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned,2,15
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices,2,15
and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was,2,15
and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away,2,15
and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and,2,15
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives,2,15
and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and,2,15
and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of,2,15
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that,2,15
as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you,2,15
as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the,2,15
bars of shittim wood five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,2,15
be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth,2,15
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore,2,15
behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and,2,15
bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad,2,15
built it and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof,2,15
children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,2,15
city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name,2,15

enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord,2,15
fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath,2,15
fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the,2,15
for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many,2,15
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah,2,15
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come,2,15
go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man,2,15
grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ,2,15
hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment,2,15
hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the,2,15
he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes,2,15
heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee,2,15
him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted,2,15
his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and,2,15
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt,2,15
i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt,2,15
i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel,2,15
in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord,2,15
in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of,2,15
in the two ouches and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it,2,15
into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire,2,15
it and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof and,2,15
it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,2,15
jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you,2,15
king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem,2,15
manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver,2,15
my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool,2,15
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred,2,15
o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come,2,15
of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel,2,15
of the court which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about and,2,15
of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way,2,15
put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately,2,15
reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem,2,15
said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people,2,15
saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance,2,15
see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and,2,15
shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and,2,15
shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea,2,15
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead,2,15
spread much abroad in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is,2,15
surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their,2,15
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery,2,15
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying,2,15
the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the,2,15
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah,2,15
the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and,2,15
the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner,2,15
the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,2,15
the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread,2,15
thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their,2,15
their families and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and,2,15
there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the,2,15
there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down,2,15
therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat,2,15
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay,2,15
they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here,2,15
thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee,2,15
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned,2,15
thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the,2,15
took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed,2,15
unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death,2,15
was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house,2,15
when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel,2,15
which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage,2,15
with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out,2,15
with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day,2,15
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not,2,15
years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom,2,15

and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil three tenth deals,4,14
and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have,3,14
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and,3,14
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will,3,14
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring,3,14
a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of,2,14
according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee,2,14
and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,2,14
and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given,2,14
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of,2,14
and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers,2,14
and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover,2,14
and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts,2,14
and his wifes name was mehetabel the daughter of matred the daughter of mezahab,2,14
and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of,2,14
